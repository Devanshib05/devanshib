# Project 1: Automotive system engineering - Digital Twin of an Autonomous Truck
- Created the necessary GUI (graphical user interface) in IBM Rhapsody and tested the interaction with the SysML models.
- Designed an HMI concept using Adobe XD that allows the driver to:
    - adjust the HVAC and the lighting in the cabins.
    - monitor the state of the physical & virtual entities and connections of the Digital Twins.
    - Cooperated on reports and applied SCRUM mechanism during the project.

# Project 2: Mobile Office in a Level-3 Autonomous Vehicle 
- Conducted interviews with target users, affinity diagramming to interpret the results.
- Created a persona and storyboards to identify the users' needs, followed by a brief literature review.
- Developed a low-fidelity concept design considering human-centered design principles using Sketch.
